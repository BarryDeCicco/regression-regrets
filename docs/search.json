A secondary aim of the study is to describe the functional form of each predictor in the model. Between January 2006 and December 2010, patients with the clinical suspicion to suffer from bacteremia were included if blood culture analysis was requested by the responsible physician and blood was sampled for assessment of hematology and biochemistry. An analysis of this study can be found in Ratzinger et al. (2014).\nThe data consists of 14,691 observations from different patients and 51 potential predictors. To protect data privacy our version of this data was slightly modified compared to the original, and this modified version was cleared by the Medical University of Vienna for public use (DC 2019-0054). Compared to the official results given in (Ratzinger et al. 2014), our results may differ to a negligible degree."

    "text": "2.1 Prerequisites for the IDA plan\n\n2.1.1 Analysis strategy\nWe assume that the aims of the study are to fit a diagnostic prediction model and to describe the functional form of each predictor. These aims are addressed by fitting a logistic regression model with bacteremia status as the dependent variable.\nBased on domain expertise, the predictors are grouped by their assumed importance to predict bacteremia. Variables with known strong associations with bacteremia are age (AGE), leukocytes (WBC), blood urea neutrogen (BUN), creatinine (CREA), thrombocytes (PLT), and neutrophiles (NEU) and these predictors will be included in the model as key predictors. Predictors of medium importance are potassium (POTASS), and some acute-phase related parameters such as fibrinogen (FIB), C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate transaminase (ASAT), alanine transaminase (ALAT), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). All other predictors are of minor importance.\nContinuous predictors should be modelled by allowing for flexible functional forms, where for all key predictors four degrees of freedom will be spent, and for predictors of medium and minor importance, three or two degrees of freedom should be foreseen at maximum, respectively. The decision on whether to use only key predictors, or to consider predictors also from the predictor sets of medium or minor importance depends on results of data screening, but will be made before uncovering the association of predictors with the outcome variable.\nAn adequate strategy to cope with missing values will also be chosen after screening the data. Candidate strategies are omission of predictors with abundant missing values, complete case analysis, single value imputation or multiple imputation with chained equations.\n\n\n2.1.2 Analysis Ready Data dictionary\nThe source data dictionary of the bacteremia data set consists of columns for variable names, variable labels, scale of measurement (continuous or categorical), units, plausibility limits, and remarks. See Appendix B.\nAn additional analysis ready data dictionary will be created to capture additional derivation, transformations and metadata relevant to the research question.\n\n\n2.1.3 Domain expertise\nThe demographic variables age and sex are are chosen as the structural variables in this analysis for illustration purposes, since they are commonly considered important for describing a cohort in health studies. Key predictors and predictors of medium importance are as defined above. Laboratory analyses always bear the risk of machine failures, and hence missing values are a frequent challenge. This may differ between laboratory variables, but no a priori estimate about the expected proportion of missing values can be assumed. As most predictors measure concentrations of chemical compounds or cell counts, skewed distributions are expected. Some predictors describe related types of cells or chemical compounds, and hence some correlation between them is to be expected. For example, leukocytes consist of five different types of blood cells (BASO, EOS, NEU, LYM and MONO), and the sum of the concentration of these types approximately (but not exactly) gives the leukocyte count, which is recorded in the variable WBC. Moreover, these variables are given as absolute counts and as percentages of the sum of the five variables, which creates some correlation. Some laboratory variables differ by sex and age, but the special selection of patients for this study (suspicion of bacteremia) may distort or alter the expected correlations with sex and age."

A numeric variable BACTEREMIAN will also be derived to enable modelling with the following coding, 0: no, 1: yes.\nFor the purpose of stratifying IDA results by age, AGE will be categorized into the following three groups: [16, 50], (50, 65], (65, 101], both with numeric (AGEGR01) and character coding (AGEGR01C).\nPredictors will be grouped by importance to the research question. Indicator flags for the predictor grouping will be derived:\n\nKEY_PRED_FL01 will indicate the key predictors: AGE, WBC, BUN, CREA, PLT, and NEU\nMED_PRED_FL01 will indicate the medium importance predictors: POTASS, FIB, CRP, ASAT, ALAT, GGT\nREM_PRED_FL01 will indicator all remaining predictors not defined as key or medium importance.\n\nNote that depending on the consequences of IDA, additional flags may be defined and derived to track the changes to the original analysis plan. For example, an addition to the key predictors can be handled by creating a new flag KEY_PRED_FL02, with an increment the index to indicate that a change has occurred. This provides traceability to the consumer of the analysis data.\nAn additional metadata flag PARCAT01 will de derived to indicate the blood cell variables which form the Leukocytes predictor (WBC): BASO, EOS, NEU, LYM and MONO."

Type of missingness has not been recorded.\n\n\n2.3.2 M2: Complete cases\nThe number of available complete cases (outcome and predictors) will be reported when considering:\n\nthe outcome variable (BACTEREMIA)\noutcome and structural variables (BACTEREMIA, AGE, SEX)\noutcome and key predictors only (BACTEREMIA, AGE, WBC, BUN, CREA, PLT, NEU)\noutcome, key predictors and predictors of medium importance (BACTEREMIA, AGE, WBC, BUN, CREA, PLT, NEU, POTASS, FIB, CRP, ASAT, ALAT, GGT)\noutcome and all predictors.\n\n\n\n2.3.3 M3: Patterns of missing values\nPatterns of missing values will be investigated by:\n\ncomputing a table of complete cases (for the three predictor sets described above) for strata defined by the structural variables age and sex,\nconstructing a dendrogram of missing values to explore which predictors tend to be missing together.\n\n\n\n2.3.4 U1: Univariate descriptions: categorical variables\nFor sex and bacteremia status, the frequency and proportion of each category will be described numerically.\n\n\n2.3.5 U2: Univariate descriptions: continuous variables\nFor all continuous predictors, combo plots consisting of high-resolution histograms, boxplots and dotplots will be created. Because of the expected skew distribution, combo plots will also be created for log-transformed predictors.\nAs numerical summaries, minimum and maximum values, main quantiles (5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, 95th), and the first four moments (mean, standard deviation, skewness, curtosis) will be reported. The number of distinct values and the five most frequent values will be given, as well as the concentration ratio (ratio of frequency of most frequent value and mean frequency of each unique value).\nGraphical and parametric multivariate analyses of the predictor space such as cluster analyses or the computation of variance inflation factors are heavily influenced by the distribution of the predictors. In order to make this set of analyses more robust to highly influential points or areas of the predictor support, some predictors may need transformation (e.g. logarithmic). We will compute the correlation of the untransformed and log-transformed predictors with normal deviates. Since some predictors may have values at or close to 0, we will consider the pseudolog transformation \\(f(x;\\sigma) = sinh^{-1}(x/2\\sigma)/\\log10\\) (Johnson 1949) which provides a smooth transition from linear (close to 0) to logarithmic (further away from 0). The transformation has a parameter \\(\\sigma\\) which we will optimize separately for each predictor in order to achieve an optimal approximation to a normal distribution monitored via the correlation of normal deviates with the transformed predictor. For those predictors for which the pseudolog-transformation increases correlation with normal deviates by at least 0.2 units of the correlation coefficient, the pseudolog-transformed predictor will be used in multivariate IDA instead of the respective original predictor. For those predictors, histograms and boxplots will be provided on both the original and the transformed scale.\n\n\n2.3.6 V1: Multivariate descriptions: associations of predictors with structural variables\nA scatterplot of each predictor with age, with different panels for males and females will be constructed. Associated Spearman correlation coefficients will be computed.\n\n\n2.3.7 V2: Multivariate descriptions: correlation analyses\nA matrix of Spearman correlation coefficients between all pairs of predictors will be computed and described numerically as well as by means of a heatmap.\n\n\n2.3.8 VE1: Multivariate descriptions: comparing nonparametric and parametric predictor correlation\nA matrix of Pearson correlation coefficients will be computed. Predictor pairs for which Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients differ by more than 0.1 correlation units will be depicted in scatterplots.\n\n\n2.3.9 VE2: Variable clustering\nA variable clustering analysis will be performed to evaluate which predictors are closely associated. A dendrogram groups predictors by their correlation. Scatterplots of pairs of predictors with Spearman correlation coefficients greater than 0.8 will be created.\n\n\n2.3.10 VE3: Redundancy\nVariance inflation factors will be computed between the candidate predictors. This will be done for the three possible candidate models, and using all complete cases in the respective candidate predictor sets. Redundancy will further be explored by computing parametric additive models for each predictor in the three candidate models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohnson, N.

These are the steps prior to the IDA analysis plan being executed.\nThe steps taken in this section are guided by the data set specification for the analysis ready data set, which is based on review of the IDA and analysis strategy.\nFor example, additional meta-data, data derivations and indicator flags are added to the source data set.\nTo support IDA, it is important that we keep track of the changes to the source data including all new modifications, data derivations and transformations. Therefore, we store references to the source data in the data folder after adding additional meta-data for all variables.\nThe format of the analysis ready data set follows that of the analysis ready CDISC data model.\n\n3.1.1 Data set transformations\nImportant meta-data is added to the data set from the data dictionary. At the stage we could select the variables of interest to take in to the IDA phase by dropping variables we do not check in IDA.\nFirst the source data set and corresponding data dictionary are loaded. The variable names are normalized.\nA new variable is created called PARAMCD which stores the abbreviated variable name as a reference. This provides a link between the dictionary and source data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe source data is then transform in to a long format to store the lab specific measurements called ADLB. A long format enables efficient data processing and also allows new transformed variables to be added during the course of IDA. Structural and demographic variables will be stored in a wide format in a separate data set named ADSL.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Add lab variable meta-data\nThe lab parameter variable information such as labels and units on to the transformed data are added directly from the data dictionary.\nAt this point, additional variables and metadata are derived per the analysis plan including:\n\nUnits\nVariable type\nCategories for sex\nrename outcome to be more informative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Reorder variables\nSelect and re-order the variables as per the data set specification.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Add informative variable meta-data\nAdd variable metadata as label attributes.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Visual check outcome is correct\nVisual check we have not introduced any errors with the outcome variable.

See Section 2.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.7 Data dervivations\nNow, derive age groups. For the purpose of stratifying IDA results by age, age will be categorized into the following three groups (Section 2.2):\n\n[16, 50],\n(50, 65],\n(65, 101].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.8 Save analysis ready data for IDA\nSave the analysis data sets in to two linked data sets following a structure similar to the CDISC ADaM data standard. Individual patient measurements are stored in a data set called ADSL. The lab specific data sets are stored in ADLB (a long format data set).\nSaving ADSL into an intermediate location DATA/IDA/ADSL_01.rds prior to IDA.\n\n\n\nSaving ADLB into an intermediate location DATA/IDA/ADLB_01.rds prior to IDA.\n\n\n\nNote: At this stage of IDA, both ADSL and ADLB are intermediate files that will be used for further IDA. Findings in IDA may require updates to either data set."

We will fit a global logistic regression model with the outcome BACTEREMIAN (i.e. presence of bacteremia) and the key predictors as covariates. We will use pseudo-log transformations as suggested in the IDA. Within the model, all key predictors will be transformed by fractional polynomials of order 1 (df = 2).\nThe aim of the examples is to showcase how decisions derived from IDA influence the results of the fitted model."

We will look at the log odds for bacteremia by each covariate on the original and the transformed scale, and compare the global model using the original and the pseudo-log transformed covariates.

    "text": "F.1 Introduction\nThis supplemental section illustrates how pseudo-log transformations can be used to transform skewed distributions towards normality.\nThe transformation \\(f(x) = sinh^-1(x/2\\sigma)/log(10)\\) is a pseudo-logarithmic transformation mentioned by (Johnson 1949). It has the following advantages over ordinary logarithmic transformations:\n\nit is defined also for \\(x=\\) as \\(f(0) = 0\\)\nit is a signed logarithmic transformation, and is defined also for negative values as \\(f(-|x|)=-f(|x|)\\)\n\nOf course, this comes at the cost of deviation from the logarithmic transformation in terms of interpretability.\nThe parameter \\(\\sigma\\) may be used to adapt the transformation to a specific range of an empirical distribution.\nWe define the pseudo-logarithmic transformation in R as:\n\n\nShow the code\npseudo_log <-\n  function(x, sigma = 1, base = 10)\n    asinh(x / (2 * sigma)) / log(base)\n\ninv_pseudo_log <-\n  function(x, sigma = 1, base = 10)\n    2 * sigma * sinh(x * log(base))"

    "text": "F.2 Impact of choice of \\(\\sigma\\)\nNext, we investigate how the parameter \\(\\sigma\\) impacts the result of the transformation.
